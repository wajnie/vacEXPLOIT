# VAC Exploit
An implementation of Valve Anti Cheat Exploit, written in C with a built-in injector.


## Basics
The basic requirements are Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or newer, with a platform toolset v142 and Windows SDK 10.0. The SDK is installed with Visual Studio, so just install the toolset.

## Setup
You are able to download a ZIP file, or git download it by running a command:
```
https://github.com/wajnie/vacEXPLOIT.git
```
The folder with all necessary files should download by itself.

## Compiling
All you have to compile here is just set the type of build configuration to `Release x86`. After that you can compile the whole project.

If everything went right you should receive .exe binary file in the `Release` folder.

## Running
1. Close Steam and all other steam-related programs (Faceit, ESEA, anything really)
2. Run the .exe file
3. Steam will start automatically as soon as the exploit injects.

## Issues with compiling?
